# Recap 2024 ðŸ’¿
A small static website I made for [boba drops](https://boba.hackclub.com/) winter event! Since we're at the end of 2024, why not make a small website about it?

## Tutorial Used ðŸ“‘
For the scroll div stacking effect, I refered to this tutorial here: [https://medium.com/@sanjeevyadavIT/card-stack-scroll-effect-486cc3b55312](https://medium.com/@sanjeevyadavIT/card-stack-scroll-effect-486cc3b55312). It was quite a old tutorial, so I had to fix some things too (also to make it work with, well whatever I'm doing).

## Intro ðŸ”¥
The website could be opened at [codingkatty.github.io/2024-recap/](https://codingkatty.github.io/2024-recap/), hosted on GitHub pages. It uses HTML + CSS (and Javascript) and has a few images added.

I've also added a few hover effects.
